# Workaround for the bug in the fritzcap. Sometimes the phone wav file is splited into
# two files before and after phone connection. The lines in the merged file are then not
# synchronized. This tool create a new mix file with the correct synchronisation and use the
# linux sox tool to create a ogg file.
#
# usage:
#    reduce_merge_audiofiles <path_to_the_folder_with_wav_files>
